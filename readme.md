# Project-Boss-Rush-2.5
Godot remake of a scratch game :3

Bugs
- A script class error message upon compilation
(Seems to have no effect for now, just keep in mind in case anything happens)
- UID warning messages, they are persistent and occur every time a project is reloaded

Stuff currently being worked on
- Add a proper tank loading system (Ellie)
- Add the first boss (Ellie)

Stuff to finish
- Add a death/respawning system
- Add a proper UI (health bars don't count)
- Add a menu screen, and level loading
