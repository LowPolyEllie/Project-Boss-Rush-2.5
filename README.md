# Project-Boss-Rush-2.5
Godot remake of a scratch game :3

Bugs
- An script class error message upon compilation
(Seems to have no effect for now, just keep in mind in case anything happens)

Stuff currently being worked on
Ellie
- Replace the global classes with plugin classes
- Add scene based tank loading
Fox
- Add a proper state machine

Stuff to finish
- Add Nova
- Add UI
- Add a menu screen

The game itself is in C#, the plugins are in GDScript
